# morse-code
A python program to translate between alpha-numeric characters and Morse code.

When translating to Morse code the output is saved to a .txt file called morse_out.txt to allow the user to copy any messages if they feel the need to.

Eventually this program will have a function to translate between English and Morse code and another to do the reverse.
It will also eventually allow the user to select which way they wish to translate.
Finally (so far as I have thought), there will be a simple front end allowing users to select which mode to use via a button and prevent users from having to use a terminal.
